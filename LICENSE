SUPER IMPORTANT LEGAL DOCUMENT
------------------------------
I don't give two hoots what you do with any of the code you find here.

Actually, I do. I hope you take it and use it, uncredited, on a super commercial website and get 
wicked rich off it. I hope you use it at work and your boss is impressed and you get a big 
promotion. I hope it helps you design a software and that software impresses somebody you think is 
super hot and you get married and have smart, chill babies. I hope you use the code in a blog post 
you write elsewhere and that website gets way more popular and awesome than this one.

If you feel like telling me about it, cool. If not, no big deal. If you feel better crediting it, 
that's cool. If not, don't sweat it.

If you copy the entire code from this repo and republish it on your own site like you wrote it,
that's a little uncool. I won't be mad at you for stealing, I just think you're better than that
and want to see you do better. I'm not going to come after you though. I'd rather play ball with my
dog. The only time I'll be mad at you is if you go out of your way to try and hurt me somehow. And 
again I probably won't even be mad, just sad. Unless I'm having a bad day too, in which case I
apologize in advance for my snarky replies.

This code is released into the public domain. Do _whatever_ you want to do with it, unimpeded. 
I'll still help you if you need it, just create an issue above. Send me a pull-request if you want
to help. You'll be committing into the Public Domain when you make a PR to this repo. Feel free to
do as you please with your fork, though.

I want the web to get better and being all Johnny Protective over everything doesn't get us there. 
I understand other people feel differently about this and might have semi-legit reasons for
protecting certain code, design, writing, or whatever. I work on some closed-source projects myself. 
This program/article isn't one of them. Go nuts.
